1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,560
I'd like to begin by addressing the heinous attack

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,608
On the United States capitol

3
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:08,192
Like all Americans I am outraged by the violence

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,752
Lawlessness and Mayhem

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,824
I immediately deploy the National Guard

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,872
And federal law enforcement

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,664
To secure the building

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
And expel The Intruders

9
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,808
America is and must always be a nation of law

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
An order

11
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,904
The demonstrators who infiltrated the capital

12
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,976
Have defiled the seat of American democracy

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,328
To those who engage in the acts of violence and destruction

14
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,888
You do not represent our cut

15
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,448
And to those who broke the law

16
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,472
You will pay

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,544
We have just been through an intense election

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
And emotions are high

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,640
But now tempers must be cooled

20
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
AECOM

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Restore

22
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,528
We must get on with the business of America

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,368
My campaign vigorously pursued every legal Avenue

24
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,904
Chicken test

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
The election results

26
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,280
My only goal was to ensure the Integrity of the vote

27
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:08,608
In so doing I was fighting to defend

28
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
American

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,264
I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,592
To verify the identity and eligibility

31
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
Hubbell Motors

32
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,152
And to ensure our faith

33
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,176
And confidence

34
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,224
That's it all future elections

35
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,296
Now Congress has certified the results

36
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,880
A new Administration will be inaugurated on January 20th

37
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,768
My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth orderly and seamless transition of power

38
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:41,120
This moment calls for healing and Reconciliation

39
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,448
2020 has been a challenging time for up

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,032
A menacing pandemic has upended the lives of our city

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
Isolated minions in their homes

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Damage our economy

43
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
Inflame countless lives

44
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,296
Defeating this pandemic and rebuilding the greatest economy on Earth

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,624
Will require all of us working together

46
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,952
It will require A Renewed emphasis on the

47
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
Civic values of patriotism

48
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
Faith charity community and family

49
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:16,704
We must Revitalize the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that bind us together

50
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
As one National family

51
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,616
To the citizens of our country serving as your president has been

52
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,152
The honor of my life

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,224
And to all of my wonderful supporters

54
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272

55
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
But I also want you to know

Is only just beginning

58
